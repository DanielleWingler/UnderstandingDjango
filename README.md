UnderstandingDjango
===================

Generic basic code with precise understandable documentation to get a django site up and running.


This repository is beginner focused and assumes that there is no prior coding experience. There is a requirement of having python already installed and a command prompt (terminal) working in ubuntu.

This code and information is based on the django 1.6 version. The official documentation can be found at ![django project website](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

The newest and constantly changing django version can be gotten from the ![djano repo](https://github.com/django/django).
