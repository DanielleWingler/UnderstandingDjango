#Statement of Purpose:

This project is meant to introduce new python programmers to Django, a popular web framework that is written in python. This specific project's intent was to delve into some of the former assignments (from an Introduction to Programming course at UNC SILS) in a new way, including writing some basic code, cloning github repos, and accessing ssh. 

Also, this site can serve as a forum for beginning programmers to share tools or methods they find useful.  All users can fork the basic django site, and with a few path changes, can experiment beyond just having a basic site.  Each user can suggest increased 

#Contribution Guidelines

Overall, this space is intended to provide support to new programmers.  The code is avialable for anyone to start a simple django website. Additionally, there is some basic information on how to host your django site. 

##Ways anyone can help with the project:

(1)Fork over the project and test it with new hosting sites.
(2) Fix bugs. Since this project is aimed a new programmers who are trying to get their feet wet in python programming, there are bound to be bugs, but that just means there is more opportunities for others to contribute!
(3) Add something new. Because this is a generic website, this project has the potential to grow in many different ways. This website can provide limitless opportunites like adding a twitter feed or a music player. This is place to experiment, so try something new. We'll all see where it leads together. 

##Ways anyone can help their fellow programmer and help themselves:

(1) Be supportive. Provide advice and show patience for those who are learning.
(2) Try! Things will break. Things won't work. But that's part of the process of learning; and this process will be life-long. 
(3) Challenge yourself and challenge others.  Try using the command line. Add to documentation. Create milestones that will test people's ability.  There are lots of ways that through challenging ourselves and others that we can all become better programmers.
