## Django site creation within pythonanywhere.com 

I created a free account with pythonanywhere.com. This greatly limits you to how many webapps you can create-- 1, in fact,
is all you can create with a free account.

This ![django tutorial](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/wiki/DjangoTutorial) was incredibly helpful in getting a basic
django site up and running within PAW (pythonanywhere.com). 

After flipping through the code provided here within the repo, the code generated locally on my computer once I created
a new django project within the terminal, and many google searches, I was able to apply the basic blog application to
the basic django site that was generated by following the above tutorial. 

My website creation can be found ![here](http://wings.pythonanywhere.com/).

It's bland right now, but design will be the next leap in my exploration of django.

## What to Expect

PAW has a great user interface and the dashboard is inviting to a beginner ready to wade into the world of code. 
If you follow the django tutorial from above and do a few quick glance-overs of the documentation provided from the official ![django project website](https://www.djangoproject.com/). 

Then you are ready to try making a django site for yourself. 

## Helpful information that made a big difference

I found it handy to have the documentation open while walking through the tutorial and creating the site at the same time. Trying to read and understand the documentation before working with the code did not help me at all, it worked better when I was doing both at the same time. 

The most pivotal bits of code while making the django site within PAW were:

```
python manage.py startapp ##

```
The ## can be whatever you want to call your application. Once you do this within the bash console provided in PAW 
it will create a directory and a series of files that are important in order to get your application working within your 
project.

```
python ./manage.py syncdb

```
The above code will update your database. With this particular project I used sqlite3. This is important to do after 
creating an application so that the database creates a new table for the new app. This is where the posts are stored
and allows me to create more posts through the bank-end admin part of the site.

## Further steps

Design and specific application information will be provided in other parts of the repo. The resources listed below
were the main sources of helpful information while creating this django website.
