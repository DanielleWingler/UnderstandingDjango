## Django site creation within pythonanywhere.com 

I created a free account with pythonanywhere.com. This greatly limits you to how many webapps you can create-- 1, in fact,
is all you can create with a free account.

This ![django tutorial](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/wiki/DjangoTutorial) was incredibly helpful in getting a basic
django site up and running within PAW (pythonanywhere.com). 

After flipping through the code provided here within the repo, the code generated locally on my computer once I created
a new django project within the terminal, and many google searches, I was able to apply the basic blog application to
the basic django site that was generated by following the above tutorial. 

My website creation can be found ![here](http://wings.pythonanywhere.com/).

It's bland right now, but design will be the next leap in my exploration of django.

The most pivotal bits of code while making the django site within PAW were:

```
python manage.py startapp ##

```
The ## can be whatever you want to call your application. Once you do this within the bash console provided in PAW 
it will create a directory and a series of files that are important in order to get your application working within your 
project.

```
python ./manage.py syncdb

```
The above code will update your database. With this particular project I used sqlite3. This is important to do after 
creating an application so that the database creates a new table for the new app. This is where the posts are stored
and allows me to create more posts through the bank-end admin part of the site.
