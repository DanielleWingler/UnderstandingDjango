# Django site creation within pythonanywhere.com 

I created a free account with pythonanywhere.com. This greatly limits you to how many webapps you can create-- 1, in fact,
is all you can create with a free account.

This ![django tutorial](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/wiki/DjangoTutorial) was incredibly helpful in getting a basic
django site up and running within PAW (pythonanywhere.com). 

After flipping through the code provided here within the repo, the code generated locally on my computer once I created
a new django project within the terminal, and many google searches, I was able to apply the basic blog application to
the basic django site that was generated by following the above tutorial.
